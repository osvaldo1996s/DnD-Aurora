			<p>Starting at 1st level, you can create a magical bond between yourself and one melee weapon allowing you to transform the weapon into an extension of yourself. During a long rest, you can spend 1 hour performing this ritual. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.</p>
			<p class="indent">While bonded to this weapon, when you attack with that weapon, you are proficient with it and you can use it as a spellcasting focus. When you make an attack using this weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls, and the weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage immunities and resistances.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can only bond to one weapon at a time this way. If you attempt bond yourself to a new weapon, you must end your bond with the previous one.</p>
