			<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and do a critical, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 7d6 slashing damage from the hit.</p>

At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you've wounded it, and it can then make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 17 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.</p>
