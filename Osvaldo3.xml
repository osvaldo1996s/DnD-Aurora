      <p>Reaction: The spell absorbs anything harmful thrown at you, and stores that energy into your weapon. You have resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn. Additionally, choose a damage type that you've absorbed. The first time you hit with a melee attack on your turn, your weapon deals an additional 2d10 damage of the chosen damage type, and the spell ends. If one of the triggering damage types was bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, then you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage until the start of your next turn.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b>  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

      <p>Your mouth is not your own as you launch into a vicious tirade of unrepeatable insults and personal attacks in Infernal, laced with bursts of intense heat on any creatures within a 20-foot cone in a direction you choose. Each of those creatures take 2d8 fire damage and if they have an Intelligence of at least 3 and can hear you, they must make a Wisdom saving throw. Creatures that fail the save suffer an additional 4d6 psychic damage and are stunned until the end of your next turn. Creatures that succeed on the save take half as much damage and arenâ€™t stunned.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, creatures that fail the save are instead paralyzed for one minute, creatures can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>
